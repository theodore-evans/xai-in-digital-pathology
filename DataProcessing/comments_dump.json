{"userProfiling_comments":"I was in a US based practice that was nearly 100% digital for ~ 2 years (2018-2020). 
We did not use any AI tools but our non-cytology / non-bone marrow specimens were 100% digitized for clinical sign out 
(Philips system). Based on clinical expectations for turn around time AND the significant decrease in 
reimbursement for pathology in the USâ€”digital pathology IS NOT finically viable in the US. 
Profit margins are not there for ROI based on the cost of scanners and even the process of having
 histology slides put on the scanner in our histology lab led to significant problems with our process. 
 Until the steps of going from tissue to an imaging are automated and streamlined there will be significant barriers to digital pathology
 (first step necessary for AI to even be in the conversation) and AI in clinical practice on the US. Just FYI. ",

"trustScores_borderlineCases_comments":"Confidence for what? positive or negative or both?",
"trustScores_borderlineCases_comments":"I felt I needed the pos or neg labels in addition to the confidence",
"trustScores_borderlineCases_comments":"High confidence should provide examples of both classes (pos. and neg.), no? ",

"counterfactuals_twoAxisCounterfactuals_comments":"It seems there may be many counterfactual examples that are more closely
related to the positive example which could be useful for understanding the nuances and building trust",,
"counterfactuals_prototypeInterpolation_comments":"Like previous, initial reaction is that interpolation is useful but doesn't give the full picture of possible negatives. 
Perhaps clicking around each cell and seeing the interpolation for each would feel more useful",
"counterfactuals_prototypeInterpolation_comments":"What is a counterfactual? ",

"saliencyMaps_localSaliency_comments":"Cool",
"saliencyMaps_globalSaliency_comments":"There is one cell slightly to the right of the center that is labeled as positive and is 
quite darkly stained by IHC, but does not show up on the saliency map, which is a bit surprising. It looks like an endothelial cell. ",
"saliencyMaps_localSaliency_comments":"Per-cell saliency is probably too much detail. ",

"conceptAttribution_textAttributes_comments":"This is excellent but I think there could be quite a
 lot of additional factors, so this would need some supervision. "}
